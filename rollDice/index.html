                        <p>
                            <p>- At the begining, enter the final score</p>
                            <p>- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</p>
                            <p>- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score</p>
                            <p>- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost, and dices will dissapear. After that, it's the next player's turn</p>
                            <p>- As this game is really famous, a lot of people have a strategy to play it, thats why NEW rule is: if both dices show 6, players GLOBAL score is lost</p>
                            <p>- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. If player choose to do so, it's the next player's turn</p>
                            <p>- The first player to reach points stated in FINAL SCORE on his GLOBAL score wins the game</p>
