my projects

My portfolio page, where you can view applications created by me. Hosted at https://vladzah.github.io/
For most of the projects, I have been using vanilla JavaScript with React.js, but I am implementing Typescript.
For API calls and other resources management I like to use Axios or Express.
Thank you for visiting.
I am going to update them, and add tests as time goes on to make it easier to read and to improve time complexity...
